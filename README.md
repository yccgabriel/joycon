## use joycon as typing machine
this is a pet project to experiment using joycon's buttons to type, using morse code as encoding.
in the first interation, used two buttons - one for dit, one for dah.
this works, but not very well, because I couldn't figure out separations between letters.
in the second interation, I used chording to type.  output is much more efficient.
for now, I'm putting this project aside.
